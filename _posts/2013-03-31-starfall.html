<p>GDC is over and I'm hanging out at <a href="https://noisebridge.net/">Noisebridge</a> with some friends. I've been inspired this week by some amazing <a href="http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/">Twine</a> games and authors so I decided to make a short one myself. It feels most like a poem to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/twine/Starfall.html">Play Starfall</a></p>
<p>This is actually my second Twine game. Ask me if you'd like to see my first.</p>
