*Last update: Jan 26, 2018*

I've been using Unity3D a lot these days for business and pleasure. I've been posting some of my code to gists on GitHub to serve as examples or as open-source components. I thought that I should collect them in one place to make the good stuff easier to browse. I intend to update this post occasionally to collect these as I make them. If you want something open-sourced, let me know here and I can add a license if there isn't one already in the file.
