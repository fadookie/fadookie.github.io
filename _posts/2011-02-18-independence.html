<p>I am on fire.<br />
  Sitting here, stir-crazy, fever over,<br />
  head full of bliss and thoughts flying faster than-</p>
<p>  On the edge of a cliff<br />
  I look out towards the horizon and see such sights-<br />
  What's there? I want to sail out and touch the sky<br />
  Soar into space<br />
  Breathe the breath of an untouched land.<br />
  Discover a place of my own.</p>
<p>  The numbers rattle in my head.<br />
  Zero, one, rpush, copy, skip if zero-<br />
  if, foreach, do-<br />
  my fingers brush the keyboard as I stare into a blank-</p>
<p>  It's on the tip of my tounge. I want to say, to shout, to pronounce<br />
  It's here! The time is now!<br />
  I know the language, but the thought eludes me.</p>
<p>  Buffer, drawback, vector, rotation, input, output-<br />
  servers crashing behind me like towers collapsing<br />
  I jump the fence, the fresh breeze of sea air filling my lungs</p>
<p>  and I'm here.</p>
<p>  Sitting here, stir-crazy, fever over,<br />
  I am on fire.</p>
