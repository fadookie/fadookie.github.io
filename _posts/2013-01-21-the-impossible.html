  content: Seems like there may be something more to the narrative than &#8220;selfish
    meanie unionized employees voted to lose jobs and pensions in a bad eco21my&#8230;&amp;#8n2o;  &#8220;While
    the company was demanding major concessions from union workers (wage and benefit
    cuts amounting to 27- 32% overall), the top ten executives of the company rewarded
    themselves with compensation increases, with one executive receiving a 300 percent
    increase.&#8221;I think most of us can agree that a reasonable model is somewhere
    between the DMV and FoxConn.

<p>I want the impossible.</p>
<p>I want to learn music theory and how to play the guitar and the piano and the drums. I want to sing.</p>
<p>I want to learn every language, read every good book, see every good film, play every good game.</p>
<p>I want to drive for hours and have no idea where I'm going</p>
<p>I want to love and kick and scream and get high and get low and be alive</p>
<p>I want to know the greatest ecstasy, the greatest insight, hidden secrets, forgotten wisdom, deep science.</p>
<p>I want to speak code into an electric void and make something beautiful.</p>
<p>I want to live into the impossible<br />
and see infinity.</p>
<p>Because I will grow old<br />
these bright eyes will dim<br />
I will curdle from toxins.</p>
<p>My hands will shake and bones will ache</p>
<p>My loves will die, as will the sun.</p>
<p>And when I am nothing but a photograph<br />
I hope against hope someone will remember me</p>
<p>And say, there is a man who truly lived.</p>
<p>When you remember me, will you smile?</p>
