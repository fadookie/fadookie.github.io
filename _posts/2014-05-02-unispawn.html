<p><a href="https://github.com/fadookie/Unispawn"><img class="alignright" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fadookie/Unispawn/master/icons/Unispawn_128.png" alt="Unispawn Icon" width="128" height="128" /></a>I've been working a lot with <a title="Unity3D Game Engine" href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> recently, and sometimes it can come in handy to have multiple instances of the editor open at once. On Mac, this works fine, but due to how the dock works, it's awkward to launch more than one instance, requiring you to root around in the app bundle and have a terminal window open.</p>
<p>I wanted a quick shortcut to spawn a new instance, so I threw together a shell script and bundled it up as a stand-alone Mac app using <a title="Platypus script bundling tool" href="http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus">Platypus</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested, you can <a title="Download Unispawn" href="https://github.com/fadookie/Unispawn/releases">download Unispawn on Github</a>. It's not really worthy of its own name and an icon, but I couldn't resist making some references and I needed it to look different from Unity in my dock. :)</p>
