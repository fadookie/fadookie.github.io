I was interviewed for [What Happened to Chiptune?](https://whathappenedtochiptune.org/), a podcast about the lifecycle of the Chiptune scene. We talked about my involvement with the Bay Area scene, my work doing [live music visuals](/works/live-music-visuals), developing the [Game Visualizer](/works/game-visualizer-1) and [Triggerboy](/works/triggerboy), and my general history with game development and thoughts about the past and future of indie games and Chiptunes.

The full interview is below. [Episode page and show notes are here](https://whathappenedtochiptune.org/episodes/eliot-lash-fKUoUVng).

Some errata and things I forgot to mention:
* I said my Bar Mitzvah (and the time I got my Genesis) was in 2010 but I accidentally transposed some digits and didn't correct myself, it was actually in 2001 which makes a lot more sense with the Genesis being end of life! At that time you could still pick up used Genesis cartridges for cheap at FunCo Land.

* I didn't explain this well but [Raphael "Raizin" Bob-Waksberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Bob-Waksberg) from [Olde English](https://www.oldeenglish.org/) is also the creator of BoJack Horseman, and [Jesse Novak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Novak) ([Tugboat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWUxxmyycDc)) scored that show. I don't think I made the connection until just now but [Adam Conover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Conover) is also involved with Olde English, it's kind of a legendary group.

* I don't know why I didn't think about this when we were discussing [Anamanaguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamanaguchi), but what I said about not getting into their more recent work is not entirely accurate. I somehow forgot when we were speaking but I did really love [the soundtrack for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off](https://scottpilgrimsoundtrack.bandcamp.com/album/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-original-series) which they wrote with [Joseph Trapanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Trapanese). I'd call it a Chiptune album among other things ([multiple musical styles are present on the album](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-soundtrack)) but I'd say many parts of it are recognizable as Anamanaguchi. This is actually one of my albums that I have been taking the time to digest, I've bought a copy of it and have had it on heavy rotation for a while. I'd definitely recommend the album and the show, they are both really well done and are a very fresh take on the property IMO.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the interview if you listen to it. I'd also recommend checking out the other episodes of the show, there's a lot of really interesting stuff if you have an interest in Chiptunes or the issues surrounding a small music scene in general.
