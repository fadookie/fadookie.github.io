<p>Triggerboy is an open-hardware electronic synchronization tool to assist in the creation of live music visuals. It is an application for the&nbsp;<a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino hardware platform</a>&nbsp;that is intended to interface with the&nbsp;<a href="http://littlesounddj.com/">LittleSoundDJ</a>&nbsp;sequencer for Game Boy handheld systems. It is a tempo/clock slave to the Game Boy and can run on-board audio analysis and FFT spectrum analysis. It uses this information to trigger the digital out pins on the Arduino in time with the music.</p>
<p>So far, Triggerboy has been employed during live performances by <a href="http://theglowingstarsband.wordpress.com/">The Glowing Stars</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://matthewjosephpayne.wordpress.com/">Matthew Joseph Payne</a> and <a href="http://slimegirls.bandcamp.com/">Slime Girls</a> to trigger circuit-bending of NES and Genesis consoles to create glitchy, 8-bit visuals. It has become a regular component in Matthew Joseph Payne's rig for live visual performance. I collaborated with Matt in the design of the unit and the development of the hardware, and wrote all of the software.</p>
<p>It is based on the open-source <a href="https://code.google.com/p/arduinoboy/">Arduinoboy</a> code and schematic with heavy modifications.</p>
<p>Here's some videos of the Triggerboy in action, driving a circuit bent game console:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lavieenphotos.net/p515976725/e4608d02c">Slime Girls @ The Crepe Place, 9/29/2012</a></p>
