        Animated GIF showing my implementation of Conway's game of life celluar automata simulation inside GZDoom. There is a grid of candles on the ground. A special gun with a switch on it starts and stops the simulation. Firing weapons toggles cells between alive or dead. An alive cell has an imp in it, a dead cell has nothing or an imp corpse.
