      Screenshot of Passage-esque game showing the pixel art Passage guy traversing a horizontal corrdidor. There are a few chests littered around the passage. The open ones have text above them that says "Rai$e!". The screen is wide but short vertically. There's a HUD on the lower right hand side of the screen that lists "Salary: $900. Soul: 60%"
