Vega Strike is an open source, open world space simulator game in the vein of Wing Commander: Privateer. I joined the project in the mid-aughts and helped with a variety of tasks including technical art and ship implementation, writing documentation, and testing the game. I also created my own mod for the game called Elite Strike with the help of the artist Szilárd Bálint, which was a fan game based on Frontier: Elite II.
