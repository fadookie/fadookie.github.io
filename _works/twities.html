<p>Visualizes the people you follow on Twitter as a 3D cityscape. The size of the building for that person corresponds to how many followers they have.</p>
<p>I was inspired to program this based on <a href="https://twitter.com/eliot_l/status/214213367336927232">some tweets</a>&nbsp;from my friend <a href="http://aliendovecote.com/">Porpentine</a>. She provided creative input throughout development and made pixel art for the ground.</p>
<p>Just a little polish remains until I'd be comfortable releasing it. The source code has been public since day one, feel free to play with it if you can get it to compile under the latest Processing! (I was using some weird nightly to make this and I had to hack in some of the GL texture parameter stuff.)</p>
