<p>I have performed as a live visualist for <a href="http://matthewjosephpayne.bandcamp.com/">Matthew Joseph Payne</a> and <a href="http://slimegirls.bandcamp.com/">Slime Girls</a>. I draw from a mixture of archival footage, films, realtime video generators/filters, and my own videos. My goal is to create a visual experience that is tightly synchronized with the live musical performance, matching the vibe of the artist and the themes found in their work.</p>
<p><a href="http://vidvox.net/">VDMX</a>&nbsp;the tool&nbsp;at the heart of my performance rig, allowing me to combine and tweak all of these elements on the fly. I have used VDMX to create a set of reactive video elements by binding various parameters to MIDI controllers, audio analysis, and tempo, which I can rebind on-the-fly during a performance. Working with VDMX has been great fun, as it is flexible enough to allow many video generators and filters to be turned into reactive visualizers with minimal effort.</p>
<p>I continue to evolve my rig, adding new video generators and tailoring my setup for the needs of the artist. I recently integrated another project of mine, <a title="Game Visualizer #1" href="http://www.eliotlash.com/works/game-visualizer-1/">Game Visualizer #1</a>, into my VDMX setup using the window capture function. This allows me to take advantage of its wonderful features while also adding an element of audience interactivity.</p>
