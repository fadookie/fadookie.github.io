I&nbsp;worked as a full-stack software engineer making prescription digital therapies for serious mental health issues at Pear Therapeutics. I was the Frontend Architect focusing on accelerating the mobile development process. Previously, I was the tech lead for core mobile libraries, Pear-004 (schizophrenia therapy app,) and several versions of reSET (addiction therapy app.) I oversaw a team of contract engineers, and was involved in product design and planning. I was the solo developer of a [multi-user VR peer support environment prototype](./vr-peer-support) for patients recovering from opioid abuse.
