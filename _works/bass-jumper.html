<p>Bass Jumper is an installation music game made for Whammy Jammy 2012. It's kind of like 4-player DDR, but the focus is on athletics rather than tracking/rhythm&nbsp;skills. You must jump into the air and land on beat in order to score points. The longer you are airborne, the more points you get if you nail the landing.</p>
<p>Daniel Plemmons, one of my teammates <a href="http://donotundo.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/i-hope-you-like-jammin-too/">did a great write-up on the the game and the jam</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the complicated set-up and hardware required to play this game (4 Arduinos, 4 accelerometers, a projector, and a laptop running Processing and Flash) it's unlikely to ever be played again. But I think its transitory nature is part of what makes it special.</p>
