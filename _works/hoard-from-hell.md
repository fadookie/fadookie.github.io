**Hoard From Hell** is a game about finally overcoming a large challenge, defeating a great foe, and the long-awaited journey back home. The satisfaction of knowing that you've accomplished something great... and now you have tons of loot around to carry home. Try to get through the already completed dungeon with as much valuable loot as possible. Careful, you have a weight limit, and your speed is heavily impacted by what you carry. Can you survive and tolerate this journey home with the Hoard From Hell at your back?!
