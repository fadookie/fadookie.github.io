<p>Combo is a game in which three players work together to achieve a common goal. It takes the form of three simultaneous minigames. The players must communicate in order to score combos across all three games to win. And also, sometimes the controls swap. :)</p>
<p>I made this with a group of Dutch indies&nbsp;during&nbsp;the Global Game Jam 2014 in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands!</p>
