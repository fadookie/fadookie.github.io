This is a visual novel I made as a fan game for [The Mutant Ages](https://twitter.com/themutantages) podcast. It's an in-joke. The best attempt I can make to explain it is to refer you to [the podcast segment it's based on](https://soundcloud.com/themutantages/ep-37-phoenix-saga-part-5-child-of-light-x-men-tas#t=49:36). However, if you have fantasies about dating Wolverine and are not a fan of the podcast (even though, in that case, you definitely should be) you may also enjoy this game!

Please play with the sound on, I think it really adds a lot.

Maddy and Ryan from the Mutant Ages did a blind playthrough video linked below. It was a blast to watch, although keep in mind that it's a short game so this video will basically spoil the whole thing!
