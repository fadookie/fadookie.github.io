      Screenshot of "Slay The Shire" showing pixel art of a court jester with a bullhorn shouting at a king (the heckler) sitting in a throne in a crowd of people. A deck of cards is shown with punchline and comeback cards. Health bars are shown for the heckler and jester and an energy indicator showing 0/5 and a deck with "5". there's also a flag-shaped "End Turn" button.

Roguelike Deckbuilding game where you play a comic that must use a deck of different comedy cards to defeat hecklers, creating a mad lib-style comedy set to make the crowd laugh.

The game is inspired by Slay the Spire and Mad Libs.

I implemented a lot of the core gameplay logic and sound effects.
