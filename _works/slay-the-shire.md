Roguelike Deckbuilding game where you play a comic that must use a deck of different comedy cards to defeat hecklers, creating a mad lib-style comedy set to make the crowd laugh.

The game is inspired by Slay the Spire and Mad Libs.

I implemented a lot of the core gameplay logic and sound effects.
