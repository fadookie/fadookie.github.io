I was the sole programmer on a project funded by [a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1465415). We developed a prototype for the Google Daydream VR system to create a virtual environment for peer support group meetings for patients suffering from opioid abuse disorder. I created a "virtual whiteboard" which broadcast a [draw.io](https://draw.io) diagram controlled by the meeting facilitator into the virtual environment in real time. Patients could also write in a virtual journal on their mobile device outside of VR, and view the journal contents while in VR. We partnered with CleanSlate Research and Education Foundation to get feedback on our prototype from real patients.
