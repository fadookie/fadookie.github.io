      Screenshot of the VR Peer Support App showing two low-poly femme avatars sitting in chairs in a courtyard environment. A large whiteboard hovers to the right, showing some text "Welcome to the... VR Peer Support Group." A thought bubble shape says "Share your thoughts." A speech bubble shape says "Speak up."

        Screenshot of the VR Peer Support App showing the journal viewing feature in the courtyard environment. A Google Daydream controller is visible with a large sheet of text protruding from the top of it, showing some lorem ipsum placeholder text. Some empty chairs and the whiteboard are visible in the background.

I was the sole programmer on a project funded by [a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1465415). We developed a prototype for the Google Daydream VR system to create a virtual environment for peer support group meetings for patients suffering from opioid abuse disorder. I created a "virtual whiteboard" which broadcast a [draw.io](https://draw.io) diagram controlled by the meeting facilitator into the virtual environment in real time. Patients could also write in a virtual journal on their mobile device outside of VR, and view the journal contents while in VR. We partnered with CleanSlate Research and Education Foundation to get feedback on our prototype from real patients.
