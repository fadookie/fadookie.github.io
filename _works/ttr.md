      Screenshot of "Tap Tap Revenge Tour" showing three tracks with tap targets falling down towards pads at the bottom of the screen. A "slicer" is being sliced with a swipe on the left side. The HUD shows a combo of 8x with a 57-tap streak, 99% accuracy, and 756,810 points.

        Screenshot of "Tap Tap Revenge 4" looking somewhat similar to the "Tap Tap Revenge Tour" one but each track has a unique color (red, green, and blue) and the red and blue ones cross over in the distance. A tap accuracy meter is shown in the upper right and a multipler meter in the upper left. A 16x multiplier powerup is shown to the left having just being used, and a "16x for 10 sec" toast is shown in the center of the screen.

My first job out of college was working for Tapulous, Inc. as a content/community manager. Days after I joined, the studio was acquired by Disney. I started off integrating music tracks into the game, managing marketing campaigns, and doing user support. I quickly tried to find ways to put my coding skills to work, automating a lot of the digital asset management work and starting to make improvements to our admin panel webapp.

After about a year I transitioned to working on the backend team full time using PHP. We supported many releases in the Tap Tap Revenge family including TTR3, TTR4, TTR Tour, many licensed stand-alone TTR games for artists such as Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, as well as a new game called Riddim Ribbon.

During the development of TTR Tour, I transitioned over into client programming, working on our custom C++ game engine and Objective-C UI code.
