        Splash screen for "Repair Game" showing the hacking robot, a beige robot with a 0 and 1 on a display in its head, sitting on a platform across a gap from another platform. There's a "Play game!" button and the controls for the game are displayed.

        Screenshot of hacking view with a green overlay on the screen. The robot is standing on a small platform and is surrounded by several other small platforms. Green hack beams extend from the robot's arms to a platform, connecting it to a hacking terminal. The exit key is floating in the top right and above it and to the right is the exit dorr. A game rule is displayed on the top of the screen: "Object moves [Vertically] at speed [1] and range [7]" "Save & Exit" button is displayed on the lower left corner.

**Repair Game:** Our platformer is broken, so it's your job to fix it! Use A and D to move left/right and use space to jump. Click on objects and a terminal to manipulate its properties. Collect the key and get through the door, and help Repair (our) Game!

I implemented a simple custom ECS framework to favor composition over inheritance and decouple game logic from data, in an attempt to make it easier to treat the game logic as a first-class construct.
