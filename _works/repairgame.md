**Repair Game:** Our platformer is broken, so it's your job to fix it! Use A and D to move left/right and use space to jump. Click on objects and a terminal to manipulate its properties. Collect the key and get through the door, and help Repair (our) Game!

I implemented a simple custom ECS framework to favor composition over inheritance and decouple game logic from data, in an attempt to make it easier to treat the game logic as a first-class construct.
