      Screenshot of "Star-Crossed Sonata" showing a rocket ship flying through a starfield on a blue background surrounded by various stars and planets. Trailing behind the rocket is a pink line, connecting the dots between various silver stars. At the top is a red health bar and at the bottom is a white beat indicator which looks like three short lines.

        Screenshot of "Star-Crossed Sonata" showing a rocket ship flying through a starfield on a blue background surrounded by various stars, planets, and an asteroid. Trailing behind and in front of the rocket is a pink line, connecting the dots between various silver stars. At the top is a red health bar and at the bottom is a white beat indicator which looks like three short lines. A small cloud of green plus marks is also trailing behind the ship, indicating a health boost was just obtained.
